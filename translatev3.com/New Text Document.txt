My Artificial Intelligence specializes in language translation with a unique speaking feature. When someone speaks in one language, the AI translates the input into another language and vocalizes the output. For example, if a person speaks in English, the system can seamlessly translate their words into languages like Hindi, Japanese, Russian, Gujarati, Spanish, and more, all while providing a spoken translation. This feature is especially beneficial for older individuals and those who may not be literate, as it enables them to communicate effectively without the need for reading or writing. I invite you to learn more about this Artificial Intelligence language translation system and its speaking capabilities, which can make language translation accessible to a broader audience
